# KW26

Developers: 
-
Fernando Trevino (myself).

Programing Language: 
-
C.

Description: 
-
This project emulates some aspects of hardware of the cryptographic equipment “Kw-26” from 1960’s that generated key strings based on a 2 number input to start a continuous chain of calculations to generate long apparently random number sequences. This program overcomes the 32 bit integer restriction of C by working with number of 40 hexadecimal digits stored in arrays of individual digits. 
The program uses hex numbers with 40 digits to start the Fibonacci sequence up to a specified number, then it takes a key string to encrypt or decrypt a given text.

Benefit: 
-
Practice encryption, string manipulation, dynamic memory allocation, and fun.
